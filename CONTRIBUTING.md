### Welcome!

Here are a few steps needed to start contributing to the Project.

* Get familiar with GitHub and our workflow
* Setup development environment
* Get familiar with project documentation

### Get familiar with GitHub and our workflow
1. Create a GitHub account using your private e-mail so that you can communicate with collaborators being out of office.
2. Send your account name to the Project Maintainer (tmandzak@gmail.com) so that he can add you to the Project Team
3. Have a look at [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/), especially at
 * [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
 * [Using pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) (we use Fork&pull development model)
 * [Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)
 * [Syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork)
 * [Writing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/88/articles)
 * [Be Social](https://help.github.com/articles/be-social)
4. Tasks are added by adding issues that can be discussed by all contributors
5. Currently our workflow looks as follows:
  * Fork a repository
  * Sync forked repository 
  * Choose an issue and inform others
  * Make a dedicated branch
  * Make a commit -> Make a pull request -> Take part in a discussion ->
    Make additional commits to a dedicated branch if needed (opened pull request is updated automatically)
  * Pull request is closed by Maintainer (merge or cancel)  

(to be updated - it's only current best thinking)
